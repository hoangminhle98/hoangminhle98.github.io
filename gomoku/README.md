# Gomoku Bot
* Gomoku is a strategy board game.
* Originally, players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection.
* In my implementation, players take turn to mark a cell with their color (green for computer and white for human player)
* The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of 5 cells horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Gomoku bot is implemented with MiniMax Algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning
